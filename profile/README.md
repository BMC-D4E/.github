# Health Equity Explorer
## Introduction
The Health Equity Explorer (H2E) is an R Shiny application that enables users to explore relationships between precomputed health outcomes and demographic, clinical, and place-based (GIS) attributes. H2Edata is a companion R package that generates the required H2E datamart by querying an OMOP CDM instance.

## Application Features
- view health outcomes over time and by patient population
- analyze trends in missing data
- evaluate collinearity in variable sets
- develop univariate and multivariate logistic regression models 
- evaluate model performance
- view health outcomes by neighborhood or census tract
- overlay health outcome data with place-based data (Child Opportunity Index, Social Vulnerability Index)

## Background and H2E Demo
The video below provides an introduction to the rationale behind H2E, as well as a brief demonstation of functionality and features.
